    <h1>Quinta do Vale</h1>
    <p>Quinta do Vale or Valley Farm is an educational game that was created with the partnership of FeedInov and the aim of teaching sustainable practices when handling an animal farm.</p>
    This game was made for the android and can currently be found in the Google Play Store in the following link:
    <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.GameDevTecnico.QuintaDoVale&hl=en_US">Google Play Store Link</a>
    <p>Quinta do Vale is a farming sim game where you inherited a farm from you mysterious relative and must now bring the farm to its full splendor.</p>
    Upon your arrival you will meet Pixel, the farmhouse robot who has been tasked with taking care of your farm for as long as they remember. Pixel will aid you with the basics of the farm and alongside your new neighbours you will be able to learn about all the tips and tricks about how to take care of animals, be sustainable, the co-dependence between industries and the legalities of having a sustainable farm.
    <p>This game was contracted by FeedInov to the student association GameDev TÃ©cnico in which I played the role of team lead and design, programming and narrative writing. Between all these skills the ones I am most proud of is the design, and narrative programming and writing.</p>
    <h3>Design</h3>
    Due to this game being an educative game for children it was required that the game must trasmit the information needed and be entertaining but not addcitive to convice children to play it. The process of design for this project started by understanding what information our contracters wanted us to share and how much of it could be told indirectly.
    
    <p>Due to a concern from parents and contractor that children should not be addcited to this game me and my team devised that the game should be structured using a system of timed events and progression bonus.</p>
    The game is based on the player generating enough money and sustainability to be able to progress through the story by playing minigames and checking on their animals atleast once per day to give them the basic needs.
    Based on games like "Animal Crossing" and "Stardew Valley" when the player completed a minigame they will have to wait a certain ammount of time before they can interact with the animals again with no way of skipping this time through the means of paying.
    This encourages the players to play the game daily in short sessions.
    
    The internal design systems is also something I am proud of. In this game, the player must buy animals and garantuee that the animals are happy before being allowed to buy more animals.
    This is because the farm can only grow if it has enough money and sustaianbility to do so. So the aniamsl generate products (every animal has a different timeline for generating their product) which grants the player with some money. The quality of the profucts depends on the happiness of the animals and the higher the quality the more it sells for. Which means that animals connect to the gain and sustainability of the farm. 
    With the money in hand, the player can then buy more animals or animalo houses or decorate the farm. Decorating the farm can also provide more sustainability points.
    Each type of animal offers a different gameplay and the player can strategize how to best optimize their farm.
    
    <h3>Narrative Programming and Writing</h3>
    Due to this game being in Unity and we having lots of narrative episodes I decideed to create a narrative system that would be accessible for everyone on our team to add narrative as they wish.
    Based on the <a href="https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/">Inkle Dialogue</a> system with unity integration I created a system that reads from .ink scripts and translates features such as text, tags, methods and variables back and forth between systems. This means that if the player is presented with a global choice in ink, ink will be able to communicate with unity and save the varaible in our save data.
    This is also practical for other dialogue features such as character protrait emotions and instance of dialogue events. To create a narrative episode the player only needs to write an .ink file and explicit who is talking and what emotions are they portarying and they can wire it directly to our game by dragging the file into our dialogue manager and chosing when they want the event to play.

    Besides this I also wrote the whole narrative for the game with the aid of FeedInov in more technical matters. To teach more complex concepts such as "what makes a farm legally sustainable" I created characters that served as the neighbours of the main character and each had their own profession. Ranging from farmer to entomologist to lawyer, each neighbour makes an apperance every few levels to either aid the player solve some issue or even ask them for aid in their area. 
    
    The narrative dialogue is also peckled with humour and fun interactions between the characters as to engage the player in the world of Quinta do Vale.
